Cfancy is a casual reamke of the original C language.

Here I'll describe is basis. The description here implies you understand 'C' language.

I'm using Unicode characters for the syntax.

First there won't be statements or macros as we already know them. 

Declarations will be prefixed by the '?' sign (this language as C will only use the standard ASCII charset). Identifiers will 
be introduced seperated with comma. Between each pair of brackets certain type will be introduced. You can initaliaze single or
multiple identifiers with the '=' sign (which will be the same as assigning the value of some expression). The default type
supposed is the 'void' one.

The default types will be simillar to 'C', except:

size //simillar to 'size_t' in C

There will still be the awkward (for some) declarators because I love them. Only the pointer declarator will remain the same here
though:
